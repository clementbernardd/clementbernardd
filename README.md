### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


- I am a 3rd year student at Telecom Paris (cursus Sophia at Eurecom) and I am currently in double degree with Polytechnique Montreal. 
- Iâ€™ve studied Data Science for 2 years at Telecom Paris (for my first year), Eurecom (for my second year) and at Polytechnique Montreal(for two years).
- Iâ€™ve worked during my studies on different projects about Machine learning : 
- - Kaggle challenges, semester project about the implementation of a recommendation system that takes into account the network and the cache of the user with Deep Reinforceâ€‘ment Learning, implementation of Autoâ€‘Encoder algorithms for semantic segmentation of RGBâ€‘D images, Chatbox with BERT fineâ€‘tuning), or Android (creation of a book reading application related to sounds and olfactories, which was nominated at the Innoâ€‘vative day of Telecom Paris), Spark (implementation of algorithms such as Kâ€‘means) which allowed me to have experiences withdistributed algorithms, Kubernetes (labs about distribution of containers and distributed scheduling).Iâ€™ve also had a 2â€‘month internship at Oscaro where I implemented a recommendation algorithm with Deep Reinforcement Learningalgorithms (Double Deep Qâ€‘Network or Deep Deterministic Gradient Policy).
